# Welcome to WFantasy!

The Fantasy WNBA App is a user-friendly web application that allows basketball fans to create and manage their own fantasy teams based on WNBA player performances

Users can sign up, log in, build, and change rosters within a fixed budget, with player values determined by real-time stats fetched from external APIs. 

Built with a Flask backend and React frontend, it integrates modern tools like Fomantic-UI for styling and UseContext for state management. 

The goal is to make a fun, accessible, well-built application that will be deployed for use, and showcase my skills as a software engineer.
